    description: "The Hyundai IONIQ 5 is the brand's first dedicated electric vehicle built on the Electric Global Modular Platform (E-GMP), establishing a new sub-brand for Hyundai's battery electric vehicles. Featuring a distinctive retro-futuristic design inspired by Hyundai's first production car, the Pony, it combines pixel-like lighting elements, sharp character lines, and a unique silhouette that defies traditional vehicle categorization. Despite appearing to be a compact hatchback in photos, the IONIQ 5 is actually a midsize crossover with a 118.1-inch wheelbaseâ€”longer than the Hyundai Palisade three-row SUV. This extreme wheelbase-to-length ratio maximizes interior space, creating a flat floor 'living space' that can be reconfigured with movable consoles and seats that recline nearly flat. The exterior incorporates many aerodynamic features including flush door handles, active air flaps, and a fully enclosed underbody. Available with either a 58 kWh or 77.4 kWh battery pack (varying slightly by market), and in single-motor rear-wheel drive or dual-motor all-wheel drive configurations, power outputs range from 168 HP to 320 HP in the performance-oriented models. Range varies by configuration, with the most efficient variants exceeding 300 miles on a charge. One of the IONIQ 5's most distinctive features is its 800V electrical architecture that enables ultra-fast DC charging, allowing a 10-80% charge in as little as 18 minutes at compatible charging stations. The interior combines sustainable materials including recyclable plastics, plant-based textiles, and bio-paints with cutting-edge technology, featuring dual 12.3-inch screens, augmented reality head-up display, and advanced driver assistance systems. As Hyundai's flagship electric vehicle, the IONIQ 5 represents the company's vision for future mobility, combining distinctive design, innovative technology, and practical electrification solutions while establishing a new design and technology direction for the brand's expanding electric vehicle lineup."
